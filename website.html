## Welcome to The Times World 

I have devloped this app using public open source API [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/client-libraries/python) which collects news information from various sources as JSON.

### JSON API

JSON is then updated in the App and rendered as news.

No monetization has been done.

Built using React Native framework(JSX). 
Only published in Play store. 
I have developed this application only to add it in resume to get a developer JOB.

For more details on how to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
